# pug-balance-bot

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. Clone the bot repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the bot's directory, and run the following command to install the required packages:
   
   ```sh
   pip install discord.py requests trueskill scipy
